# Handwritten-Digit-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The objective of this project is to predict handwritten digits using Deep Learning Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and to compare the accuracy of both models using the MNIST dataset.
